# Day 1: Inception of Verilog Simulator-iVerilog, yosys and Skywater

On the First day, We learnt about the different tool used here  i.e.(iVerilog-Used for RTL Simulation and Gate Level Simulations,yosys-Opensource Logic Synthesis Tool,Skywater 130nm Standard Cell Libraries) and concept of simulation and synthesis were analysed.
